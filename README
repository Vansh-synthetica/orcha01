Orcha 0.1
**Modular Multi-Expert Orchestration Engine**

Orcha is a high-performance orchestration runtime for executing multiple AI experts in parallel, selecting the best outputs, retrying weak results, and producing a coherent final answer.

Designed for modular AI systems, research, and real-world deployments.

---

Why Orcha?

Most AI systems rely on a single large model.

Orcha enables:

- Intelligent task decomposition  
- Smart expert routing  
- Parallel execution  
- Confidence tracking  
- Automatic repair & retry  
- Output aggregation  
- Budget-aware compute  
- Explainable decision paths  

Instead of **one big brain**, you get **coordinated intelligence**.

 Core Features

 Intelligent Decomposition
Break a query into structured subtasks automatically.

 Expert Selection
Choose only the experts relevant to the task.

 Parallel Runtime
Massive latency improvement via concurrent execution.

 Aggregation Engine
Combine outputs into a single coherent response.

 Retry Logic
Low confidence → reroute or re-execute.

 Explainability
Trace which experts ran and why.

 Pluggable Experts
Bring your own models or APIs.

 Installation

```bash
pip install orcha01


Quick Example
from orcha01 import Orchestrator
from orcha01.experts.base import BaseExpert


class MyExpert(BaseExpert):
    async def run(self, query: str) -> str:
        return "hello from expert"


orc = Orchestrator()
orc.register_expert("demo", MyExpert())

result = orc.run("say hi")
print(result.final_answer)
